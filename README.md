# Data Analysis Gapminder 
Data analysis and Data visualization on the Dataset of Gapminder, explains about GDP per capita as a measure of average income per person in a country. This dataset contains information about population, life expectancy, and gdp percapita from 1952 till 2007 for each country. In this project we are going use python to address certain questions.

### Variables used in this dataset are:
1.  country = Country
 1.   year = Data collected year
1.    population = Population of each country
1.    continent = Continent where country is located
1.    life_exp = Life expectancy at birth
1.    gdp_cap = GDP per capita



### Understanding of dataset
Before moving to any dataset, we must have to understand each variable properly. For example, in this dataset nearly all columns are self-explanatory, but gdp_cap may be confusing. In this project, we have two different datasets containing information about Gapminder. Both datasets have common keys.

GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. This measure National income / National Output and National expenditure.

GDP per capita divides the GDP by the population.

Rest of the columns are self-explanatory.
